            The Kagan are an indigenous group in Davao who have largely embraced Islam, blending their ancestral customs with Islamic beliefs and practices. 
            They primarily inhabit the highlands of Davao, where farming and small-scale trading form the backbone of their livelihoods. The Kagan maintain 
            traditional practices, such as ritual ceremonies and communal gatherings, while integrating Islamic teachings into their daily lives.

            Their spiritual life includes prayers, observance of Islamic holidays, and respect for both ancestral spirits and Allah. Music, dance, and oral 
            literature continue to play an important role in preserving their culture. Traditional attire, often adorned with local designs, is worn during 
            significant events and ceremonies, reflecting both heritage and religious identity. The Kagan are known for their close-knit communities, where 
            kinship, cooperation, and mutual respect are highly valued. Leadership is typically guided by elders and community councils, which oversee cultural 
            and religious matters. They face challenges such as cultural assimilation, land disputes, and the pressures of modernization, but continue to uphold 
            their identity. Education and cultural programs have been introduced to help preserve their language, traditions, and practices.
