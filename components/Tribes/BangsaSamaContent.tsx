            The Sama people, also called Sama Dilaut or Badjao, are a maritime indigenous community in the southern Philippines, primarily living in the 
            Sulu Archipelago, Tawi-Tawi, and coastal areas of Mindanao. Their culture is closely tied to the sea, as many Sama live in stilt houses along 
            the shore or aboard houseboats called lepa, which they skillfully navigate. Fishing is central to their livelihood, supplemented by small-scale 
            trading, boat-making, and crafts. Music, dance, and oral literature are important cultural expressions, often performed during ceremonies, 
            celebrations, and community gatherings. They practice a combination of Islam and animistic beliefs, showing respect for nature, ancestors, 
            and spiritual forces.

            to younger generations. Education and cultural programs help preserve Sama heritage amid modernization and external pressures. Their maritime lifestyle 
            emphasizes adaptability, resilience, and a deep connection to their environment. Rituals, prayers, and festive celebrations are intertwined with daily 
            life, reflecting both spiritual and cultural identity.
